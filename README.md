## INTRODUCTION
  Project developed for the course "Advance Coding Tools and Methodologies", held in the Master degree of Music and Acoustic Engineering, based in "Politecnico di Milano". 
  The project aims at the production of generative music threw the combination of different melodic and rythmic music styles, different instruments. Every component is represented by a simple and friendly visual component

## Implementation
 Given the unusual nature of the system built, it is implemented using mostly raw HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT code, some frameworks and instruments have been used for the development in order to speed up and enhance the results obtained by the system: 

- [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [NES CSS](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/)
- [Shepherd.js](https://shepherdjs.dev/)
